Java - CollocationsFinder - in Computational Linguistics collocations are words that appear together much more often than they would only by chance. This program can be trained on any text (I have sort of a tradition to use "Moby Dick" which can be downloaded in full here (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701 - I recommend plain utf-8 text version), then based on some factors (like how the training data is related to the words you are looking for) it will tell you if any 2 words you want to search for are collocations. For the sake of this simple implementation I assumed a word pair is a collocation if its probability is greater than the product of the individual probabilities.
